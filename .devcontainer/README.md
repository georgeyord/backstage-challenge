# Run in VSCode using dev containers

**OPTIONAL!**

We use dev containers to run this project without disturbing the local machine setup. Dev containers use docker containers to run the NodeJS app(s) in an isolated environment.

To use is:

- Open the repo folder in VSCode
- Follow the suggestion to open it using devcontainers or go to Command Pallette -> Open Workspace in Container...
